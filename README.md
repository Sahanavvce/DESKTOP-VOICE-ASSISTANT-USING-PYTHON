# DESKTOP-VOICE-ASSISTANT-USING-PYTHON
-->Artificial Intelligence personal assistants have become plentiful over the last few years. 
-->Applications such as Siri, Bixby, Ok Google and Cortana make mobile device users‘ daily routines that much easier.
-->You may be asking yourself how these functions. Well, the assistants receive external data (such as movement, voice, light, GPS readings, visually defined markers, etc.)
        via the hardware‘s sensors for further processing - and take it from there to function accordingly. 
-->Not too long ago, building an AI assistant was a small component of developers‘ capacities;
-->however, nowadays, it is quite a realistic objective even for novice programmers. 
-->To create a simple personal AI assistant, one simply needs dedicated software and around an hour of working time. 
-->It would take much more time, though, to create something more advanced and conceptually innovative.
-->Nonetheless, well thought-out concepts can result in a great base for a profitable startup.
-->Let us consider the six most renowned applications based on artificial intelligence concepts that can help create your virtual AI assistant app. 
-->But there‘s there is only few voice assistant available for Core Windows platform consisting of the users. 
-->So, this is actually a major problem for users where there could be internet instability, server problems and places where internet is not accessible.
