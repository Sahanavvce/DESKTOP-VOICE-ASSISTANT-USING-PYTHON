# DESKTOP-VOICE-ASSISTANT-USING-PYTHON
A Desktop voice assistant(DVA). 
I named this assistant as "GOOGLY".
It is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions.
Desktop voice assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices.
